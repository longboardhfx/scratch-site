{"body":"### Welcome to LongboardHFX.\r\nWe're currently in the very early development stages.  \r\nBut check back soon!  \r\nIn the meantime, check out the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/longboard.halifax).\r\n\r\n### EVENT NOTICE: \r\nThere is an event in the planning stages: no firm details yet but it looks like July 28th with a rain date of the 29th.   \r\nCheck the facebook group as this site isn't up yet.\r\n\r\n### Help Wanted\r\nWe're looking for Help. We are in search of anyone who has web design or development skills.  \r\nWe also need people interested in organizing events, contacting local authorities and local politicians to help us make longboarding a safer, and more legal form of green, healthy transportation.  \r\nContact Alex Moriarty (@moriarty).\r\n\r\n### Plan for the Future. \r\nLongboarding isn't exactly a legal form of transportation. It's a very grey area.   \r\nThis is bad. Because if you get into an accident, you will likely be at fault. No matter what actually happened.\r\nIf you're driving on the road, and get hit by a car: you were 'playing on the road', which despite Canada's tolerance for street hockey, is illegal. If you're in a bike lane, you're breaking the law. If you're anywhere on the street other than a crosswalk, you're breaking the law. If you're on a pathway, you need to yield to everyone and everything.\r\nWe don't have the specific details for Halifax. But they'll be directly linked to this site soon.  \r\n\r\nBut if you're interested, [Here](http://skritch.blogspot.de/2011/04/is-skateboarding-illegal-in-toronto.html) is a blog post about the legality of skateboarding in Toronto. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nRyan Jewells, Facebook group organizer  \r\n[Alex Moriarty](@moriarty), Website admin  \r\n[Olinga Munro](@olinga), Website dev  \r\n[Allan Lavell](@infinitree), Website Dev & Graphics  \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you want something posted, an event or links to videos or photos send an email to:  \r\nwebmaster at longboardhfx.ca","name":"Scratch-site","tagline":"Scratch Site","note":"Don't delete this file!
