          <h3>Welcome to LongboardHFX.</h3>

<p>We're currently in the very early development stages.<br>
But check back soon!<br>
In the meantime, check out the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/longboard.halifax">Facebook group</a>.</p>

<h3>EVENT NOTICE:</h3>

<p>There is an event in the planning stages: no firm details yet but it looks like July 28th with a rain date of the 29th.<br>
Check the facebook group as this site isn't up yet.</p>

<h3>Help Wanted</h3>

<p>We're looking for Help. We are in search of anyone who has web design or development skills.<br>
We also need people interested in organizing events, contacting local authorities and local politicians to help us make longboarding a safer, and more legal form of green, healthy transportation.<br>
Contact Alex Moriarty (<a href="https://github.com/moriarty" class="user-mention">@moriarty</a>).</p>

<h3>Plan for the Future.</h3>

<p>Longboarding isn't exactly a legal form of transportation. It's a very grey area.<br>
This is bad. Because if you get into an accident, you will likely be at fault. No matter what actually happened.
If you're driving on the road, and get hit by a car: you were 'playing on the road', which despite Canada's tolerance for street hockey, is illegal. If you're in a bike lane, you're breaking the law. If you're anywhere on the street other than a crosswalk, you're breaking the law. If you're on a pathway, you need to yield to everyone and everything.
We don't have the specific details for Halifax. But they'll be directly linked to this site soon.  </p>

<p>But if you're interested, <a href="http://skritch.blogspot.de/2011/04/is-skateboarding-illegal-in-toronto.html">Here</a> is a blog post about the legality of skateboarding in Toronto. </p>
